# go-by-example

# 1. Hello World
- Our first program will print the classic “hello world” message. Here’s the full source code.
# 2. Values
- Go has various value types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc. Here are a few basic examples.
# 3. Variables
- In Go, variables are explicitly declared and used by the compiler to e.g. check type-correctness of function calls.
# 4. Constants
- Go supports constants of character, string, boolean, and numeric values.
# 5. For
- for is Go’s only looping construct. Here are some basic types of for loops.
# 6. If/Else
- Branching with if and else in Go is straight-forward.
# 7. Switch
- Switch statements express conditionals across many branches.
# 8. Arrays
- In Go, an array is a numbered sequence of elements of a specific length. In typical Go code, slices are much more common;    -arrays are useful in - some special scenarios.
# 9. Slices
- Slices are an important data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays.
# 10. Maps
- Maps are Go’s built-in associative data type (sometimes called hashes or dicts in other languages).
